      <b>Avengers: Endgame</b> is a 2019 American superhero film based on the
      Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and

      sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the
      <b>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</b>. It was directed by Anthony and Joe
      Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features
      an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo,
      Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul

      The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War â€“ Part 2,
      but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as
      directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the
      script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the
      MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters.
      Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette
      County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in
      January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown
      Atlanta areas, New York, Scotland, and England. The story revisits several
      moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from
      throughout the franchise as well as music from previous films. The
      official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of
      $356 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.
